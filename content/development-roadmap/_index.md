# /Technology and development roadmap

From a technical standpoint the Hashback system will have two components: different client-side front-end applications and ARDSL Framework for the Blockchain and back-end side.

Over next months Hashback will build all of the necessary modules for both front-end reference apps as well as add-on back-end capabilities and blockchain.

We will build the following solutions: front-end reference apps (web, iOS, Android), an SMS verification subsystem, back-end reference apps, smart contracts, code documentation.

Major system components:

In order to do this we will employ technical teams using the proceeds from the ITG as described in the financing section of our website >>>.

Technologies we use:

* Node.JS
* Google CDN

* Ethereum Blockchain
* Solidity

All source codes will be submitted to Hashbackâ€™s GitHub repository located at: [https://github.com/hashback ](https://github.com/hashback)

All of the following decisions are preliminary and subject to modification by the development team from time to time.

All projects will be tracked using project management tools for GitHub. Teams will use Agile/SCRUM methodology for project management.
