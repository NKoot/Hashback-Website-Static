Dimitry emigrated from Russia to the United States in 1989 while pursuing a graduate degree in microbiology at Moscow State University. He finally settled in New York in 1995 after making his way via Austria, Italy and the U.S. south to attend Columbia Law School.

Dimitry studied corporate fraud from Professors John C. Coffee Jr., Bernie Black and Judge Jed Rakoff and has been litigating serious fraud cases ever since. He also studied contract law from the late great Professor E. Allan Farnsworth, "One of America's most renowned legal scholars on contracts," and a "reporter for the influential 1981 Restatement (Second) of Contracts.” Dimitry worked as professor Farnsworth’s research assistant and book editor, 1L; winner of the Class of 1913 Prize in Contracts; and has been litigating sophisticated contract cases ever since.

He is a teaching fellow in civil procedure for the class of the late great Prof. Harold Korn, expert in New York Civil Procedure, and the famous Judge Jack Weinstein. “Mutuality vel non of collateral estoppel is mother's milk to me,” Dimitry states. James Kent Scholar; Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar; senior editor at Columbia Law Review; summer and part-time associate at Wachtell Lipton -- the most profitable and prestigious corporate law firm in the U.S. He spent eight more years at Wachtell after graduation defending Fortune 100 companies, Wall Street banks and hedge funds in white-collar crime, fraud, hostile takeover, and securities class action cases regularly featured in the WSJ and NYT. Two years at Kasowitz in multi-billion-dollar fraud, RICO, takeover and antitrust cases on both the plaintiffs' and defendants' side. Then Dimitry spent three years in Switzerland suing governments worldwide on behalf of Philip Morris International, the most profitable and litigious tobacco company in the world. After that he spent four years back in New York representing Forbes billionaires in investigating and prosecuting international fraud cases.

Dimitry now prosecutes serious corporate fraud cases against large companies with his own practice.
