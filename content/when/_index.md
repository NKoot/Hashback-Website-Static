First-on-board service providers that join now will enjoy a Grace Mining Period. To access this program Hashback will verify your participation manually. You will need to have a proof of existence, a license, or be listed in one of the known networks with a good reputation score.

The Grace Mining Period will start with the release of our Miner application at the beginning of our ITG event.

Please note: registration and verification process timeframes are not guaranteed and in some cases may take up to several weeks.

Please Submit an application form for early access to be considered. We may request additional documents for verification purposes.
