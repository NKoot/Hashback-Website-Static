# Hashbackers

Hashbackers are everyday blockchain users who want to own tokens early and the best possible rate through our pre-ITG program and also become the first users of Hashback and its  new service to book and order services over the network once it is launched.

With Hashback there is a technical mandate to distribute the initial set number of tokens for the network to work properly. The Initial Token Generation (ITG) of the “HBK” (proposed token denomination) will take place in three stages as described further. Any individual with an Ethereum wallet will be able to purchase HBKs.

For the blockchain we will use Ethereum and more particularly, an ERC 20 token standard:
[https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard)


The HBKs will be used as:

* A resource to finance the project’s development.
* A source of initial Tokens to kick-start the Hashback economical model.
* A programmable rewards program.

## Early development and funding

Hashback’s Initial Token Generation (ITG) will take place using Ethereum smart contracts. Participants choosing to support the project will be directed to a specified ITG Ethereum address where Hashback tokens will be generated and issued in value equal to the contribution at the specified Hashback/ETH exchange rate. ITG participants will be able to send Ether (ETH) to the crowdfunding Ethereum address only after the start of the crowdfunding period (specified as the Ethereum block number). Crowdfunding will expire when the specified end block is created or when the ITG minimum is reached.

Hashback will launch a pre-sale of its Ethereum Pre-ITG tokens that will be converted in favor of the primary token contract through a specialized safe migration function after the official ITG process commences.

## Pre-ITG (HBKP tokens)

In order to launch a successful ITG we need Hashbackers to help us raise the prerequisite amount of funding. Stage 2 will be capped at 10,000 ETH. The funds raised during the Stage 2 will be allocated as follows:

All issued HBKP tokens will convert to the ITG at a x1.3 conversion rate

## HBK tokens

Hashback token generation is a necessity. Without it there will be no tokens to pay for services in the network initially. Since the verification process cannot be completed without paying for services no token can be mined before another token is spent.

The amount of tokens needed depends on the number of service providers that will initially join the system; therefore, the initial token generation (ITG) will be structured as a multi stage event continuing for 6 months or until the final cap is reached.


| Duration | Tokens cap | Number of service providers joined |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 months | 1,000,000,000 | 0-10,000|


Assuming each service provider lists an average of 100 service units each costing 100 tokens for a duration of 10 time periods, the total cap of 10,000 service providers during the 6 month ITG period will require an initial 1,000,000,000 tokens. This would be a perfect start for the hotel industry’s summer session.

If for example, a night of accommodation at a hotel costs 100 tokens and an average stay is 10 days, such a hotel will need 1,000 tokens to mine the initial tokens for 10 days of its idle period when no reservations occur.

For each 1,000 service providers that join, the amount of tokens generated will be increased by an additional 100,000,000 as will the token price be increased, and so until all 10,000 service providers join.

Crowdfunding terms include:

* ITG will proceed through the native Hashback application using Ethereum smart contracts.

* ITG will depend on the number of service providers that join the network during the ITG and will be capped in total at the equivalent of USD 1 bln. or 6 months or 10,000 service providers.

* Hashback token transfer will be restricted for security reasons for one (1) month after the crowdfunding cycle ends. All unredeemed tokens will be burned.

* The mandatory minimum of funds necessary for collection in order to move into the ITG phase are USD one (1) million. If not reached, all money received will be refunded to participants accordingly.


## Grace Mining Period

First-to-access service providers that join during these initial 6 months will enjoy a grace period of mining. These initial service providers will be able to list their service units for 6 months (or less - from the time they join until completion of the ITG period) without having to physically provide any services and they can mine at a maximum mining efficiency formula coefficient. They will thereafter receive their mined tokens via the standard process when reservations are made through Hashback once the system launches. All service providers will be verified manually by the Hashback team.

## Use of proceeds:

| Pool | Description | Percentage of total funds raised |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| R&D | System implementation, testing & deployment | 30% |
|Sales & Marketing| Adoption of Hashback protocol by business users<br> Direct marketing and sales<br> Social media and advertizing|40%|
|Community building and technical support|Build diverse community of users, developers, marketers, etc. (Hashbackers) <br>Technical support for business users and consumers|20%|
|Legal| |5%|
|Miscellaneous, unexpected| |5%|

**HBK token economics and governance will be discussed in a separate document**

Founders’ fee
At the end of the ITG, the founding team will retain 10% of their HBK tokens subject to a 36 month vesting schedule. These tokens will serve as a long-term incentive for the founding team. 90% will be spent on direct costs according to the roadmap we lay out. Funds gathered during the ITG phase will create the capital required for Hashback to operate starting from the development stage and are expected to be sufficient enough to sustain the project through to 2022.
