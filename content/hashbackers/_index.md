# Hashbackers

Hashbackers are everyday blockchain users who want to own tokens early and at the best possible <span style="font-size: 1rem;">rate through our pre-ITG program and also become the first users of Hashback and its new service&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">to book and order services over the network once it is launched.</span>

With Hashback there is a technical mandate to distribute the initial set number of tokens for the <span style="font-size: 1rem;">network to work properly. The Initial Token Generation (ITG) of the “HBK” (proposed token&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">denomination) will take place in three stages as described further. Any individual with an Ethereum&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">wallet will be able to purchase HBKs.</span>

For the blockchain we currently are using Ethereum and more particularly, an <span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">ERC 20 token standard</a>

Hashback stays current with new technologies and as the blockchain market develops we may <span style="font-size: 1rem;">certainly decide to use technologies other than Ethereum moving forward, e.g., Tezos. But this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">remains to be seen.</span>

The HBKs will be used as:

* A resource to finance the project’s development.

* A source of initial Tokens to kick-start the Hashback economic model.

* A programmable rewards program.

Early development and funding

Hashback’s Initial Token Generation (ITG) will take place using Ethereum smart contracts. Participants choosing to support the project will be directed to a specified ITG Ethereum address where Hashback tokens will be generated and issued in value equal to the contribution at the specified Hashback/ETH exchange rate. ITG participants will be able to send Ether (ETH) to the crowdfunding Ethereum address only after the start of the crowdfunding period (specified as the Ethereum block number). Crowdfunding will expire when the specified end block is created or when the ITG minimum is reached.

Hashback will launch a pre-sale of its Ethereum Pre-ITG tokens that will be converted in favor of the primary token contract through a specialized safe migration function after the official ITG process commences.

Pre-ITG (HBKP tokens)

In order to launch a successful ITG we need Hashbackers to help us raise the prerequisite amount of funding. Pre-ITG will be capped at 10,000 ETH. The funds raised during the Stage 2 will be allocated as follows:
