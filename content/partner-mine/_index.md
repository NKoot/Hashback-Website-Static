# Partner Mine

Hashback is easily the most beneficial service provider partner network ever! If your organization meets the following criteria, you should be on board, and the earlier you join, the more benefits you will receive.

1. Hashback Proof-of-Stage (see link for a description >>>) applies to any industry providing services that are predicated on short term contracts, that is, those where the phrase “time is money” is to be taken literally.

2. Any professional service that loses money during down times and relies on continuous sales revenue from regular orders as well as repeat customers (loyalty), including organizations relying on third party intermediaries to facilitate and guarantee those orders, now have a powerful untapped asset.

The energy of Proof-of-Stage can only be released in a decentralized environment. The economic principles of the blockchain can transform valuable time into actual time based crypto-value that you can mine at any point when orders are not coming in and then collect them the minute those orders do come in. Now all of the fees that you have been paying to third party intermediaries are unnecessary and you can quite literally put money back in your pocket, which is where the term *Hashback* comes from. This is the very principle of what we offer the new economy.

## Grace Mining Period

First-to-access service providers that join our “Partner Mine” partner program during the initial 6 month multi stage token generation event (Initial Token Generation or ITG) will enjoy a grace period of mining. These initial service providers will be able to list their service units for 6 months (or less - from the time they join until completion of the ITG period) without having to physically provide any services and they can mine at a maximum mining efficiency or at the optimum Hashback potential. They will thereafter receive their mined tokens via the standard process when reservations are made through Hashback once the system launches. All service providers will be verified manually by the Hashback team prior to approval.

Once the third party broker is removed via the blockchain, Hashback allows the original service provider to deal direct with the customer on its own terms, volition and credibility. While removing all of the unwanted troubles and costs associated with third party services, Hashback nevertheless retains for the provider all of the positive bells and whistles that those third parties once provided; in other words, trust without middlemen. In exchange, the customer relies on information provided directly from the source and/or from others who have previously rated that source from personal (and direct) experience, because reviews, ratings and reputations are permanent fixtures that cannot be tampered with in the blockchain. The customer can then add his or her impression of the services provided to further refine the provider’s reputation and thereby offer the next customer a clearer picture of service quality in advance of purchase.

As we come to see, the progressive result over time is a truly competitive landscape established on a direct provider-customer basis. True competition with no third party interference produces a genuine free market where competition cannot be artificially manufactured, and where more and far better options are available to the provider in terms of self development and to the customer in terms of choice.
