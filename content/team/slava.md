Viacheslav has over 20 years of multifaceted development experience with embedded S/W, client-server solutions and mobile applications. He is an expert in information security and has managed LG Electronicsâ€™ cryptography research and security protocols and mechanisms for over 15 years. Viacheslav was instrumental in the design and implementation of security solutions for numerous LGE products from mobile and home entertainment/automation as well as automotive. Before that he prototyped computer vision solutions for startup NantMobile, focusing on recognition of static images and video sequences including TV programs. The output was a complicated ecosystem consisting of mobile clients, cloud-side workers and cloud database for recognizable samples.
