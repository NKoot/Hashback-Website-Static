Anton is a linguist, an outgoing nerd, and someone who refuses to shave his thin, visually misplaced beard despite all failed attempts to convince him otherwise. On the bright side, there’s this:

Anton is a brilliant software developer and engineer with a myriad of successful mobile
and web application projects to his credit. His responsibilities include software architecture,
professional front and back-end engineering, as well as interface and interaction design
projects emphasizing optimal user experience.

He is an individual commonly known as a “tech prodigy” and has for eight years been recruited to re-engineer struggling software startups that hit a brick wall. Most recently he took micro-cap Smilart UG Stuttgart/Smilart LLC, a facial recognition micro-cap software development company using open source algorithms for holistic face detection, and produced for them a viable, sellable product in under eighteen months. Prior to Smilart, Anton assisted Simple Solutions LLC, a photo editing software startup to gain traction in the Russian marketplace amongst its competitors by creating an online version of their product that social media networks use successfully to this day. Before that he gained work experience at the Computer Security Agency in Russia developing a social network multipurpose platform. Prior to that Anton worked on his own independent project in the virtual reality space, in particular, he enhanced VR for compatibility on mobile platforms for smartphones. Anton was a major contributor in protracting the usage of real-time databases for the universal chat platform Chatnbook as well as others.

Anton has earned numerous awards and honors in programming competitions, most recently from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
