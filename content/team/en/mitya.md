Dmitry is our chief visionary whose inception is now the global strategy we call Hashback. He is the architect of the company’s idea and team leader of Hashback’s concept. He has led numerous technical teams to success and has developed a wide range of innovative solutions, including most recently, Chatnbook and ModUp. “Mitya” as he likes to be called, was the co-founder and CEO of BrainsMatch, which developed innovative matching algorithms for
the recruitment industry. Prior to that he was co-founder and CEO of Popular Telephony which
invented and patented serverless p2p technology. He was co-founder and CEO of Internet
Telecom Ltd., one of the first IP telephony core technology development companies that led to
the adoption of IP in broadband cable and PBX. In 2000, as a highly sought after
and well regarded expert in the heyday of the internet telecommunications industry boom, he
was instrumental in the growth and sale of Internet Telecom to Terayon Communications
Systems (NASDAQ: TERN) in 2000. He trained as a media communications producer-director
and became influenced by the expansion of the internet in the early 90s. He became one of the
first to recognize and develop VoIP. Mitya co-founded and managed Delta Three Communications (NASDAQ: DDDC), the first global VoIP service provider in the US, the
technology that we so commonly use today. During the late 80s he also co-founded the First
Open University in St.Petersburg, Russia, before moving to Israel. He is a co-author of several
patents in serverless p2p technologies.
