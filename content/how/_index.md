# How

Hashback is a decentralized blockchain based “Proof-of-Stage” token that can be utilized in any services industry where short term contracts for accommodations, reservations, rentals, leasing, intermittent and time based rate services apply.

## What we do

We systematize the entire services lifecycle into 5 stages, the first of which mines rewards for service providers and each consecutive stage thereafter proves the physical performance of the preceding one until the token is earned and can be claimed. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Comprehensive anti-scam and anti-spam mechanisms, many of which are built straight into the protocol.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Patent pending.</span>
