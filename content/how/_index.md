# How

Hashback is a decentralized blockchain based “Proof-of-Stage” token that can be utilized in any services industry where short term contracts for accommodations, reservations, rentals, leasing, intermittent and time based rate services apply.


## What we do
We systematize the entire services lifecycle into 5 stages, the first of which mines rewards for service providers and each consecutive stage thereafter proves the physical performance of the preceding one until the token is earned and can be claimed. Patent pending.

Comprehensive anti-scam and anti-spam mechanisms, many of which are built straight into the organizational model ensures that Hashback’s security is military grade.

A mathematically derived and inherently anti-inflationary token infrastructure means that Hashback is inflation risk free.

## Why we do it
By eliminating 3rd party expenses the service provider can literally pay himself those expenses back in the form of mining revenue while users of Hashback get transparency in service, more options, quicker and simpler access to those services, and the power to totally influence -- truly impact -- customer experience and train the market to respond to ratings and build loyalty.

This sequential quantification offers a new dimension in the service sector to create an entirely new economic model in the process of ordering and offering services, including quality control. This invites new players to the shared economy paradigm who are right now stuck in the agent model due to traditional economic limitations.

Any service provider that can use Hashback (see list >>>) can mine tokens and build their own revenue rather than paying it to 3rd parties as they do now. The best part is, it is as easy as signing up. You do not need any equipment, no programming knowledge, and no advanced understanding of the shared economy infrastructure or the blockchain for that matter. It’s as easy as using an app. Learn more >>>

Much like Bitcoin and Ethereum for the financial industry, through Proof-of-Stage Hashback creates trust without intermediaries for services where time itself is the product, building reputations and loyalty directly between the service provider and the customer, giving the blockchain community access to buy services direct and the service provider a new market and approach.

This is a remarkable time and the shared economy is a magnificent creation with limitless possibilities that can bring the free market back to where it should be. With Hashback both the company and the user gain equally while the Hashback token is intrinsically built to grow.

Moreover we believe Hashback will greatly benefit the blockchain as more and more participants are steered into its ecosystem. We want to create an express lane that will help them merge smoothly and confidently into this journey.
